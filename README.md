# SQL Data Warehouse Project

**Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.**

Welcome to my **SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project is part of my portfolio and showcases my skills in designing, building, and analyzing a data warehouse using SQL Server. It demonstrates real-world practices in data engineering, ETL development, and analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three data layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Ingests raw data from source systems (CSV files) into SQL Server.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleanses, transforms, and standardizes data for analytical use.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready, star-schema-modeled data optimized for analytics and reporting.
